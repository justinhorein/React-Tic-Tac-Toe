### React Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the official react getting-started tutorial on the site.  Essentially, its a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with time travel functionality, meaning you can transport back to past turns and review or even rechoose your move.  This was my first hands on exercise with react, I learned alot of React specific concepts including: how to pass data through props, class vs. functional components, lifting state in-order to store and display game data more effectively and lots of stuff inbetween.  I also learned general programming techniques such as Data Immutability, that is, storing past records of the games state instead of mutating one set of the games data inorder to display past states of the game, essentially enabling the time travel feature.
